# Final JavaScript Test

It will be about all the JavaScript you’ve learned, from JavaScript1 to JavaScript3.

## Purpose of the test

We want to make sure you understand and master the material well enough to confidently go on in the program. We also want to see if you can keep up with the pace.
Test material
The test will be about all main JavaScript concepts we have discussed for the past weeks of JS. The following are the most important that will be tested:

- `Functions & Variables`
- `Scope`
- `Loops`
- `Callbacks & Promises`
- `Array functions`
- `Conditional statements`
- `DOM manipulations`
- `XMLHttpRequests & API calls`
- `Try…catch`

## How to prepare optimally

For each of these you must be able to (1) write the basic code structure of it, (2) know when to apply them, and (3) apply it coherently with the rest of your code.

## What type of questions to expect

You are expected to solve several coding challenges. These include DOM manipulation and making API Calls.

## What tools to use

This test will be done on your laptop. You may use Google to help you out, but not the code from your homeworks.

## Time and location

The test will be held in the usual place, will start at 11.00 and takes about an hour to complete. Doors will open at 10:45 the latest so please be in time.
