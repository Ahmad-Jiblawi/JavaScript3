## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

So far we've learned about various programming concepts. These are the basics of what makes up any application: it's the **WHAT** of programming. However, now that you're familiar with them it's time to go to the next level: the **HOW** of programming.

Like in any field, you first have to master the basics before you can create your own style of creating something new. Let's say that you want to start playing a musical instrument: the piano. At first you have to learn the basics: the different scales, notes, melodies, tempo (music basics), then you have to learn how to compose songs (the piano applied to songs). Once you understand all of that is it time to learn a specific **style** of playing piano.

It's the same way with programming.

Up until now you implicitly learned a basic way of writing code, called `procedural programming`. In this style we break problems up into functions and variables, and execute them as one long procedure. There is no real thought behind code organisation or reusability, it just needs to be executed. In this style we essentially say: "Hey computer do this, then that, and also this and later that." There is not much thought put into it.

> If you ever read about different "programming paradigms", you might we wondering how that relates to this. Actually, it's the exact same thing as a "programming style", it's just a fancier name for it.

However, in the evolution of programming languages programmers started to think more about code organization. This is how different programming styles have evolved. The fundamental question people asked was: **how can we make writing code more organized and reusable?**

In this week you'll be exposed to one such programming style that evolved: `object oriented programming` (or OOP for short). OOP is a fundamentally different way of writing software: instead of breaking up a problem in variables and functions that operate on those variables, we break problems up into "entities" that interact with each other.

> Just to make sure you completely get the idea here: OOP is about a different way of thinking about how to write software. The concepts of variables, functions, promises, API (calls) and error handling all still apply. It's just that the way code is organised is differently. Instead of creating long procedures, we create objects that interact with each other.

### A different way of thinking

OOP is a set of ideas on how to approach writing software. At the core of it we're trying to think about a computer program in a way that's similar to the real world.

Instead of writing loose variables and functions, we try to group them together into categories: in OOP we call this a `class`. Each class serves as a **template/blueprint**, and represents a real-world entity (like a person, animal or vehicle)

![OOP Classes](../assets/OOP.png)

A class consists of 3 things: (1) an identity, (2) attributes, and (3) behavior. The identity is the name of the entity.

```js
class Person {}
```

When defined like above, it's merely a definition. It's not an `instance` of it. Or in other words: it's just a new category, not yet a real person.

### 4 pillars of OOP

Almost anything that evolves within programming does so to solve a certain problem. HTML was developed to make document sharing over the Internet simple and straightforward. CSS was developed to make documents more user-friendly.

The problems that OOP tries to solve is the question we saw before: how can we write code in an organized and reusable fashion?

The answer that OOP gives us can be summarised in 4 pillars. To illustrate these pillars let's use a simple example:

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Mohammad',
  age: 28,
  walk() {
    return `${this.name} is walking!`;
  },
};
```

1. **Encapsulation**: In the example data and operations (that manipulate that data)are grouped together. This is called `encapsulation`. The main benefit is that this keeps our code organised. The second benefit is that putting objects inside of a 'capsule' we can prevent direct manipulation by outside sources, this is called `data hiding`. This reduces dependencies between objects, so that change in one place doesn't affect the rest of the application.

2. **Abstraction**: Let's say we had a Complexity of logic hidden away, creating a simpler interface (remote controller to a tv). Only expose the essentials. Abstracting away complexities to create an easier to use element.

3. **Inheritance**: eliminates redundant code by inheriting properties and methods in new instances. This encourages code reusability.

4. **Polymorphism**: an object can have many forms of expression, depending on the context. Let's say we inherit

Any class that exists or is made follows these pillars.

## 2. ES6 Classes

### Data structures revisited

Programming is not about "just writing code". It's about 2 things: **information** and **communication**. Everything else flows from those two basic ideas.

In programming we take this idea of "information" apart and categorize it into what we call `data structures`. Each data structure serves its own category, and allow us to communicate.

### Objects

In JavaScript, objects are special. In your programming so far you most likely have created objects like this:

```js
const anObj = {
  name: 'Cool Object',
};
```

This is called an `object literal`, and it's a valid way of creating an object. However, writing it like this "abstracts away" a lot of what's happening behind the scenes.

> To abstract away refers to intentionally hiding the details of how something complex works in order to simplify things conceptually. For example, the remote to your television is a complex device, but all of this is abstracted away so you don't have to deal with it. You just press the ON button and it works.

You can write the same thing by using the Object `constructor function`.

```

```

Well what is a constructor function ? Let's start at the beginning: `factory functions`.

### Factory functions

If we want to create an object we can just use an `object literal` and we're done. But what if we want to create hundreds of object instances of that same object?

For that we use `factory functions`. Don't let the name mislead you though, a factory function is just a regular function. However, the single differentiating factor is that it always returns an object instance: it is a factory that produces object instances, hence the name `factory function`. Here's an example:

```js
// Defining a blueprint for a person:
function createPerson(name, age) {
  var obj = {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    walk: function() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is walking!`);
    },
  };
  // other code to manipulate our object in some way here
  return obj;
}
```

This is the most simple way of defining a `class` and creating object instances from it. Now every time we call this function we're creating a new person object.

```js
const noer = createPerson('Noer', 27);
const wouter = createPerson('Wouter', 33);
const federico = createPerson('Federico', 32);
```

- [JavaScript Factory Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpegXpQpb3o)

### Constructor functions

`Constructor functions` are ordinary functions that have a special purpose: to create object instances. You can consider them the more advanced version of `factory functions`.

Here's an example:

```js
// // Defining a blueprint for a person:
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

The difference with a factory function is the way to instantiate it. Instead of just calling it we have to use the keyword `new`, like so:

```js
const noer = new Person('Noer', 27);
```

- [Constructors and object instances](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS#Constructors_and_object_instances)

### Classes

As you've learned in the previous section, in JavaScript we can do this using `factory/constructor function`.

Since ES6 we can make use of the `class` keyword, which is a way to create constructor objects as well. It's essentially the same thing as a constructor function, only written in a clearer and more straightforward way.

## 3. Async/Await

Last week you learned about Promises. To recap, here's what we learned: in order to introduce **asynchronicity** in our applications we use `callbacks`.

```js
const someFunc(param1, callback) {
  const callback(param1);
  return;
}
```

Then we learned about how Promises are an improved on callbacks, by providing the developer with a more readable syntax that avoids **callback hell**. We can call them callbacks version 2.0.

```js
new Promise(reject, resolve).then(...);
```

And now we've arrived at the latest upgrade of the callback mechanism: `async/await`.

```js
```

### Error handling

As you might have noticed, the Async/Await doesn't give us a way to do error handling like it does in the Promise object.

In the Promise object we have access to the `catch()` function,
