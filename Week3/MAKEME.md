## **4. PROJECT: Hack Your Repo III**

This week you will work with all JavaScript files in the `src` folder. The assignment consists of two parts:

1. Refactor all `.then()` and `.catch()` methods with `async`/`await` and `try...catch`.
2. Refactor your application to use `ES6 classes`.

#### 2.2.2 ES6 Classes

This final assignment requires you to go the extra mile and master Object Oriented Programming and ES6 classes.

In this assignment you need to redistribute and adapt the code from `index.js` to the files `App.js`, `Repository.js` and `Contributor.js`. You do not need to modify `Util.js`.

| File             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `index2.html`    | You should load this HTML file in your browser instead of `index.html` to work with the classes version of your homework. It loads the following JavaScript files through `<script>` tags in the `<body>` element: |
| `App.js`         | The `App` class contains the start-up code and manages the overall orchestration of the app.                                                                                                                       |
| `Repository.js`  | The `Repository` class holds code and data for a single repository.                                                                                                                                                |
| `Contributor.js` | The `Contributor` class holds code and data for a single contributor.                                                                                                                                              |
| `Util.js`        | The `Util` class contains static helper methods for use in the other classes.                                                                                                                                      |

The `App.js`, `Repository.js` and `Contributor.js` files each contain skeleton code that you can use to migrate portions of your code from `index.js` to.
