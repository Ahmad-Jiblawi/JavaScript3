   - Callback Hell
   - ES6 Update
3. Fetch API
4. Thinking Like a Programmer III

## 1. JavaScript Versions

You are undoubtably different than when you were a baby. Back then you couldn't really do much: crying, laughing and taking dumps. That's pretty much it. But as the years past you increasingly could do more and more: walking, socializing or playing an instrument.

This is where Promises come in. The concept of a Promise, in execution, doesn't add anything new. It does exactly what callbacks aim to do, which is enabling asynchronous actions: for example, clicking a button to load in an image, while still being able to navigate the webpage.

What

So, in effect, you could call Promises the updated version of callbacks. Callbacks version 2.0.

## 3. Fetch API

Last week you learned about making API calls. For repetition's sake
