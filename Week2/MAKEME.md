## **4. PROJECT: Hack Your Repo II**

The homework for week 2 will build on the work you did in week 1. You will create a new branch based on the `week1` branch.

1. Make sure that you committed all changes in the week 1 version of your homework.
2. Create a new `week2` branch:

   ```
   git checkout -b week2
   ```

### 3.2 Assignment

You will continue to work on the files `index.js` and (possibly) `style.css`.

- Replace all asynchronous callbacks (e.g. as used with XMLHttpRequest) by ES6 promises.
- Beautify your app's styling.
- If not yet completed in week 1, make your app responsive (use CSS media queries and [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)).

1. Push your `week2` branch to GitHub:

   ```
   git push -u origin week2
   ```

2. Create a pull request for your `week2` branch.

> Note: Please remove all redundant, commented-out code and console.log's from your files before pushing your homework as finished. There is no need for your mentors to review this stuff. Also, please make sure your code is well-formatted and follows the recommended naming conventions.
