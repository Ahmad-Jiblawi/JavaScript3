# Module #4 - JavaScript 3: Object-Oriented Programming and working with APIs (Frontend)

![JavaScript3](./assets/javascript3.png)

Welcome to JavaScript3! In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs!

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Learn what an API is
- Catch up on the history of JavaScript
- Understand how to write
- Connect with different public APIs

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!
